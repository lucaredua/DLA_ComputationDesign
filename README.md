# DLA_ComputationDesign
The code is a simulation of diffusion-limited aggregation on any mesh. The project involved reproducing a natural phenomenon using the Rhinoceros 3D/Grasshopper environment and the Python component. This work was developed during the winter semester at the University of Stuttgart between 2022 and 2023, as part of an academic exchange programme.
